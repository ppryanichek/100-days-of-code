# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Java and git. Made a simple calculator ;)

### Day 2: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied in-depth (Input/Output) in Java. Wrote 2 programs:
1: Calculates factorial.
2: Merge of sorted arrays.

**Thoughts** Not a very progressive day :/ For a long time I couldn`t figure out how to work with BigInteger. Tomorrow I need to work a little harder...
**Link(s) to work**
