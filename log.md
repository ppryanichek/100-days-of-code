### Day 7: October 20, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I gained more knowledge about Java classes, including static, internal, anonymous, and enum classes. 

Tried to solve the problem of Duck Duck Goose on codewars. The problem solved, but program run out of time, so I peeped into the answer and realized how to solve this problem.

### Day 8: October 21, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I worked with List and ArrayList, made a simple timer that counts the program's runtime (made it in package).

### Day 9: October 22, Tuesday

Worked with regular expressions and wrote a program to check the PIN code (from CodeWars).

### Day 10: October 23, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Read about the difference between Comparator and Comparable. Continued studying Java Collections Framework. 

Solved the problem (Convert an array of ones and zeros into an integer).

### Day 11: October 24, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I've mostly been solving challenges on CodeWars today. 

Learned a bit about exceptions in Java (exception types), about try-catch-finally, trow and trows blocks.


### Day 12: October 25, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Got into the study of exception processing. 

Started studying multithreaded programming.

### Day 13: October 26, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about thread priority in Java, how to get and set threadâ€™s name, a bit about thread pool and about daemon thread in general.

### Day 14: October 27, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about thread group and thread safety. 

Found out how to pass functions as a variables. 

### Day 15: October 28, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Shutdown Hook. 

Started studying Java Synchronization. 

Also learned about Record keyword

### Day 16: October 29, Tuesday

**Today`s Progress**: Worked with Date type. Made a simple CLI clock with date and time. Repeated synchronization of blocks and methods in Java.

### Day 17: October 30, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Mutex, Lock, Monitor and Semaphore. 

Also learned the differences between Atomic and Volatile variables.

### Day 18: October 31, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I started studying File class in Java and decided to make a CLI task tracker. 

At the moment I realized adding and writing task object to file.

### Day 19: November 1, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I wanted to add the ability to change task data in CLI Task Tracker, I spent a long time and realized that I made a mistake in the very beginning. 
I decided to write it all from the beginning. 

### Day 20: November 2, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned how to read and write files in Java. 

Started rewriting the task tracker (put classes in packages and made a normal version of adding a task).

### Day 21: November 3, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: I learned about JSON files. 

Alas, today I failed to output tasks from a file. 

### Day 22: November 4, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Made a CLI task tracker! Not without the help of the internet and peeking at other people's solutions ðŸ˜”. 

Took a long time with json (couldn't read json file because of extra comma in line appending).

### Day 23: November 5, Tuesday

**Today`s Progress**: Nice! I got blocked at X. 

Got a little familiar with build systems like ant, maven, gradle. 

Added comments to the task tracker and finished a couple of little things.

### Day 24: November 6, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Today was a lazy day :/ 

Most of the time I was trying to figure out how to work with junit to make tests to task tracker (still haven't done it). 

### Day 25: November 7, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I realized that I had a bad understanding of packages and project structure, so I learned it. 

I also went deeper into working with files (learned about BufferedInputStream) and wrote a small program for an example.

### Day 26: November 8, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I practiced deleting files and learned the regex again (a bit hard to remember).

### Day 27: November 9, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: 
* Wrote a program from the codewars task. 
* Figured out how to test the program.
* Learned about markdown file formatting.

### Day 28: November 10, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I started learning about java networking. Learned in general about network classes and sockets. 

Tried to repeat the one-way configuration of the server and client to output messages using a socket (so the mistake is still somewhere, but I'll figure it out tomorrow).

### Day 29: November 11, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: My brain refused to work today. I tried to solve a problem on CodeWars (it turned out with a small crutch, but I passed the test).

### Day 30: November 12, Tuesday

**Today`s Progress**: Made one-way message transmission from client to server and message acknowledgement. 

Solved the problem on CodeWars "Stop gninnipS My sdroW!"

### Day 31: November 13, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: I tried to realize multi-user message passing via socket. Today I wrote only the server side and client a bit. I really want to sleep...

### Day 32: November 14, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I made message passing between users, but I can't stop by key "stop" or "end". :((

### Miss a day

I'm exhausted today. Haven't slept well in a week.
Gonna get some sleep and continue tomorrow. 
It's 101DaysOfCode now.

### Day 33: November 16, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: I finally made a multi-user chat via socket. 

I should have used hashmap instead of linkedlist to be able to assign names to users (I have all users on the other side named "User 2" :)

### Day 34: November 17, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: 
* Learned about generics, generic classes and wildcards in java. 
* Read about IPv4 & IPv6. 
* Raised kata on codewars now I have 6 kyu.

### Day 35: November 18, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Started to understand how to work with Stream API. Took apart a couple of examples and tried to solve a task on codewars using Stream (didn't work). 

This topic is hard for me, I think it will take enough time... I'll continue tomorrow.
