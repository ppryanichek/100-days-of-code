### Day 1: October 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Java and git. Made a simple calculator ;)

### Day 2: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied in-depth (Input/Output) in Java. Wrote 2 programs:
1: Calculates factorial.

2: Merge of sorted arrays.

### Day 3: October 16, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Java arrays (util.Arrays and reflect.Arrays).
Wrote a program to remove duplicate elements from the array.

### Day 4: October 17, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned how to work with the String class, what is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder, what StringJoiner and StringTokenizer are. Wrote a program to iterate over the characters of a String in Java

### Day 5: October 18, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Studied access modifiers, OOP in Java (encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance). Worked with abstract methods and interfaces. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't understand how to work with newInstance, I think I will get to it later. 

### Day 6: October 19, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Found out about interfaces such as: functional, nested, marker. Understood what Singleton class and Lazy initialization are, how, when and what implementation of Singleton to use.

### Day 7: October 20, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I gained more knowledge about Java classes, including static, internal, anonymous, and enum classes. 

Tried to solve the problem of Duck Duck Goose on codewars. The problem solved, but program run out of time, so I peeped into the answer and realized how to solve this problem.

### Day 8: October 21, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I worked with List and ArrayList, made a simple timer that counts the program's runtime (made it in package).

### Day 9: October 22, Tuesday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about memory management in Java, stack and heap, and Garbage Collector. 

Worked with regular expressions and wrote a program to check the PIN code (from CodeWars).

### Day 10: October 23, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Read about the difference between Comparator and Comparable. Continued studying Java Collections Framework. 

Solved the problem (Convert an array of ones and zeros into an integer).

### Day 11: October 24, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I've mostly been solving challenges on CodeWars today. 

Learned a bit about exceptions in Java (exception types), about try-catch-finally, trow and trows blocks.


### Day 12: October 25, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Got into the study of exception processing. 

Started studying multithreaded programming.

### Day 13: October 26, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about thread priority in Java, how to get and set threadâ€™s name, a bit about thread pool and about daemon thread in general.

### Day 14: October 27, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about thread group and thread safety. 

Found out how to pass functions as a variables. 

### Day 15: October 28, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Shutdown Hook. 

Started studying Java Synchronization. 

Also learned about Record keyword

### Day 16: October 29, Tuesday

**Today`s Progress**: Worked with Date type. Made a simple CLI clock with date and time. Repeated synchronization of blocks and methods in Java.

### Day 17: October 30, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Mutex, Lock, Monitor and Semaphore. 

Also learned the differences between Atomic and Volatile variables.

### Day 18: October 31, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: I started studying File class in Java and decided to make a CLI task tracker. 

At the moment I realized adding and writing task object to file.

### Day 19: November 1, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I wanted to add the ability to change task data in CLI Task Tracker, I spent a long time and realized that I made a mistake in the very beginning. 
I decided to write it all from the beginning. 

### Day 20: November 2, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned how to read and write files in Java. 

Started rewriting the task tracker (put classes in packages and made a normal version of adding a task).
