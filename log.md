# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about Java and git. Made a simple calculator ;)

### Day 2: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Studied in-depth (Input/Output) in Java. Wrote 2 programs:
1: Calculates factorial.

2: Merge of sorted arrays.

### Day 3: October 16, Wednesday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned about Java arrays (util.Arrays and reflect.Arrays).
Wrote a program to remove duplicate elements from the array.

### Day 4: October 17, Thursday

**Today`s Progress**: Learned how to work with the String class, what is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder, what StringJoiner and StringTokenizer are. Wrote a program to iterate over the characters of a String in Java

### Day 5: October 18, Friday

**Today`s Progress**: Studied access modifiers, OOP in Java (encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance). Worked with abstract methods and interfaces. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't understand how to work with newInstance, I think I will get to it later. 

### Day 6: October 19, Saturday

**Today`s Progress**: Found out about interfaces such as: functional, nested, marker. Understood what Singleton class and Lazy initialization are, how, when and what implementation of Singleton to use.

### Day 7: October 20, Sunday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I gained more knowledge about Java classes, including static, internal, anonymous, and enum classes. 

Tried to solve the problem of Duck Duck Goose on codewars. The problem solved, but program run out of time, so I peeped into the answer and realized how to solve this problem.

### Day 8: October 21, Monday

**Today`s Progress**: Today I worked with List and ArrayList, made a simple timer that counts the program's runtime (made it in package).
